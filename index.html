            <p>
                I'm a former carpenter turned full-stack web developer, eager to bring my unique blend of skills to your team. My carpentry journey, starting with my dad after high school, specialized in rough carpentryâ€”framing the skeleton of projects. As my family grew, so did my ambition to innovate, leading me to digitize my carpentry skills. While carpentry and coding differ, I've successfully made the transition. Now, I'm actively seeking opportunities as a full-stack developer, equipped with a commitment to functionality and user-friendly design. Outside of coding, I lead a worship team at my church, expressing my love for singing and playing the guitar. Weekends are filled with cheering for the Chiefs and exploring downtown Kansas City with my wife, Claire.

                I'm excited to join a team that values fresh ideas, continuous learning, and individual growth. Let's discuss how my unique journey and dedication to excellence align with your company's goals.
