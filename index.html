                Carpenter turned full stack web developer with a passion for creating useful applications. My career as a carpenter started by learning from my dad right out of high school. Over the years, my specialty became rough carpentry, or framing the skeleton of a project. As my family grew, so did my ambition to develop and provide. Thus began my journey to digitize my framing skills. I can confirm carpentry and coding are nothing alike outside of the words framing and skeleton. Today, I am seeking work as a full-stack developer. My time is also spent leading the worship team at church where I exercise my passion for singing and playing guitar. My weekends often consist of watching the Chiefs and exploring downtown Kansas City with my wife, Claire. My goal is to join a team that encourages new ideas, learning and career growth.
